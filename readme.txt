Removes the annoying prototype.js call from wp_head()

== Description ==

Removes the annoying prototype.js call from wp_head().
This is only to be used if prototype.js is unnecessarily included in wp_head() (hint: look at the source).
Removing the prototype.js call from wp_head may break some plugin functionality.
Use with caution.
